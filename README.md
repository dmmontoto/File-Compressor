## Installation

For installation, there are some steps that should be followed after cloning this repository. The user needs to utilize the Makefile to build and compile the C++ programs in the project. When the user runs `make`, it will compile compress and uncompress using the specified dependencies and compiler flags. If you run `make gprof`, it will enable profiling for both programs. Additionally, using `make clean` removes the compiled files.

## Usage

Once you have completed the installation, you can either create / use your own files through the project or try out the compress and uncompress files on the example files included.
